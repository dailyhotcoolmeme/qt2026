## Packages
framer-motion | For smooth page transitions, tab switching, and the 3D flip book effect

## Notes
- Using Replit Auth for user identity.
- The app uses a mobile-first layout (max-width: 450px).
- TTS (Text-to-Speech) logic uses the browser's native `speechSynthesis` API.
- Font selection relies on Google Fonts (Noto Sans KR, Noto Serif KR, Nanum Gothic).
- 3D Flip Book effect requires `perspective` utilities in Tailwind.
